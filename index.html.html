 <h1>My favorite game Rainbow Six Siege</h1>   
    <h3>What kind of game is Rainbow Six Siege?</h3>    
<p>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is an elite, realistic, tactical, team-based shooter where superior planning and execution triumph. It features 5v5 attack vs. defense gameplay and intense close-quarters combat in destructible environments.

    Choose from over 60 operators, each with unique gadgets and customizable weapon loadouts. Outthink your opponents by breaching walls, floors, and windows, or lie in wait with deadly traps.
    
    In Defense mode, coordinate with your team to transform your environments into impregnable strongholds. Fortify your positions, place traps, and create defensive systems to prevent the enemy team from breaching in. Then, hold your positions and ambush your opponent to ensure victory.
    
    In Attack mode, observe the enemy positions and craft your cunning plan to breach in the enemy defenses, then execute your strategy by leading your team through narrow corridors, barricaded doorways, floors, windows, and reinforced walls. The right team can overcome any defense to win.
    
    Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is constantly expanding: each season brings new content, in-game events, and more.</p>
